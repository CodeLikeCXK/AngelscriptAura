# AngelscriptAura
This project rewrites the [GameplayAbilitySystem_Aura](https://github.com/DruidMech/GameplayAbilitySystem_Aura) (a companion project to [a Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/unreal-engine-5-gas-top-down-rpg)) project using Angelscript. During the rewriting process, I read a lot of documents and codes to achieve the same effect as C++ and Blueprint. Sometimes I encountered something that I couldn't do, and even submitted a [PR](https://github.com/Hazelight/UnrealEngine-Angelscript/pull/517) to the UnrealEngine-Angelscript official to solve it.

Since this project is based on GAS, and GAS is a more complex feature in UE. Therefore, if you can use Angelscript to rewrite such a project, then writing other types of projects should be easy.

Therefore, this project is a good Angelscript learning and reference material.
